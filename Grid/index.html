        <p>Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk! No, I'm Santa Claus! Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as "the brig". I am the man with no name, Zapp Brannigan!
I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day. For the last time, I don't like lilacs! Your 'first' wife was the one who liked lilacs! I love you, buddy! Whoa a real live robot; or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume?  Eeeee! Now say "nuclear wessels"! Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars. Say what? Goodbye, friends. I never thought I'd die like this. But I always really hoped.  And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet, Nibbler, who's gone to a place where I, too, hope one day to go. The toilet. Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun? Bender, being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket.</p>

          <p>Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by "devil", I mean Robot Devil. And by "metaphorically", I mean get your coat. Our love isn't any different from yours, except it's hotter, because I'm involved.  You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit! Hey, whatcha watching? You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you'll be doing. In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms.</p>

          <p>Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk! You can see how I lived before I met you. We'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go home. And until then, I can never die? I wish! It's a nickel.</p>

          <p>Professor, make a woman out of me. Meh. I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at Elzars. Explain that. Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk! I just told you! You've killed me!</p>

          <p>I videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail them later. Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really have the pure strength of 'will'? Guess again.</p>
